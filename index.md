title: Life Satisfaction and Housing conditions in London
subtitle: Does housing has an influence on people's life satisfaction and happiness?  
Could the 33 boroughs of London allow us to uncover the housing and neighborhood conditions that make people happy?

# Why this study?

Cattaneo and al., in their paper Housing, Health and Happiness, discuss the influence of housing on health and welfare by studying the impact of a large-scale household Mexican government program. They found that housing upgrades significantly improve adult welfare, as measured by increased satisfaction with their housing and quality of life, as well as lower depression and perceived stress. This raises an interesting point: how does their findings generalize to other cities? Is it possible to establish links between housing and life satisfaction in a big European city? We decided to extend their work by looking at a data set on housing in London.
We explore the possibility to find such housing influence through London boroughs. If our study context is certainly different from theirs (the housing conditions in these two countries are rather different), we will also compare information of small closely related locations (London boroughs) to uncover the influence of housing in these neighborhoods on their inhabitants' life.
